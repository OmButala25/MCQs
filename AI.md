    1) Expert Systems
    2) Robotics
    3) Natural Language Processing
    4) None of the mentioned

**Answer**  : None of the mentioned (Option 4)

*Explanation: All of the above are the examples of Artificial Intelligence.*

> Q2. What is an ‘agent’?

    1) Perceives its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators
    2) Takes input from the surroundings and uses its intelligence and performs the desired operations
    3) A embedded program controlling line following robot
    4) All of the mentioned

**Answer**  : Option 4

*Explanation: An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving and acting upon the environment through the sensors and actuators. Mean it takes input from its environment through sensors, performs operation and gives output through actuators.*

> Q3. What is the difference between Artificial Intelligence and Natural Intelligence?

    1) Artificial Intelligence is a subset of Natural Intelligence
    2) Artificial Intelligence is a superset of Natural Intelligence
    3) There is no difference between Artificial Intelligence and Natural Intelligence
    4) None of the mentioned

**Answer**  : Option 2

*Explanation: Artificial Intelligence is a superset of Natural Intelligence. Natural Intelligence is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.*

> Q4. The field that investigates the mechanics of human intelligence is?

    1) History
    2) Cognitive science
    3) Psychology
    4) Sociology

**Answer**  : Option 2

*Explanation: Cognitive science is the field that investigates the mechanics of human intelligence.*

> Q5. Performance Measures are fixed for all agents.

    a) True
    b) False

**Answer**  : (b) False

*Explanation: Performance Measures are not fixed for all agents.*

> Q6. Agents behavior can be best described by ____________

    1) Perception sequence
    2) Agent function
    3) Sensors and Actuators
    4) Environment in which agent is performing

**Answer**  : Option 2

*Explanation: An agent’s behavior is described by the agent function that maps any given percept sequence to an action, which can be implemented by agent program. The agent function is an abstract mathematical description; the agent program is a concrete implementation, running on the agent architecture.*
