**Answer :** Option 4

*Explanation : movie recommendation systems cluster the users in a finite number of similargroups   based   on   their   previous   activities and   profile.  Then, at a  fundamental   level,people in the same cluster are made similar recommendations.In some scenarios, this can also be approached as a classification problem for assigningthe most appropriate movie class to the user of a specific group of users. Also, a movierecommendation system can be viewed as a reinforcement learning problem where itlearns by its previous recommendations and improves the future recommendations*
