         translation of assembly language 
         into machine language
      3. Program that accepts a program 
         written in a high level language 
         and produces an object program
      4. A program that places programs 
         into memory and prepares them 
         for execution

## Unit 3

>Q1. What is the action of parsing the source program into proper syntactic classes known as

      1. Interpretation analysis
      2. General syntax analysis
      3. Syntax analysis
      4. Lexical analysis

**ANS: 3. Syntax analysis** 

*Explaination: The action of parsing the source program into the proper syntactic classes is known as syntax analysis. A syntax analyzer or parser takes the input from a lexical analyzer in the form of token streams. The parser analyzes the source code (token stream) against the production rules to detect any errors in the code. The output of this phase is a parse tree.
In syntactic analysis, parse trees are used to show the structure of the sentence, but they often contain redundant information due to implicit definitions.Parsing, syntax analysis or syntactic analysis is the process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language, computer languages or data structures, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar.*

        language
       4. None of the mentioned

7. Which is considered as the sequence of characters in a token?

       1. Mexeme
       2. Lexeme 
       3. Texeme
       4. Pattern

**ANS: 2.Lexeme**

*Explaination:  Lexemes are the string of alphanumeric characters in a single token. In the source program, lexemes are characters which are identified by the pattern for a token.*

>Q8. Which of the following component is important for semantic analysis?

       1. Yay
       2. Lex
       3. Type checking
       4. Symbol table

**ANS: 3. Type checking**

*Explaination: In the semantic analysis, type checking is an important component because it verifies the program's operations from the semantic conventions.*

>Q9. Which phase of the compiler is also known as Scanner?

      1. Syntax Analysis
      2. Lexical Analysis
      3. Semantic Analysis
      4. Code generation

**ANS: 2. Lexical Analysis**

       1. overwrites the word
       2. overwrites the functionality
       3. generates an error 
       4. something else

**ANS: 3. generates an error**

*Explaination: Reserved words are known as keywords and they are specific and reserved with its functionality to a language. Thus, getting an input with the same name by the analyzer will generate an error.*

>Q14. A lexical analyzer reads the source code line by line.

       1. True
       2. False

**ANS: 2. False**

*Explaination: A lexical analyzer reads the source code letter by letter and when it encounters a space or an operator or any special character, it decides that the word is completed.*
