### Extras ;)

>Q1. Physical or logical arrangement of network is __________

    a) Topology
    b) Routing
    c) Networking
    d) Control

**Answer: a**

*Explanation: Topology in networks is the structure or pattern in which each and every node in the network is connected. There are many topologies in networking like bus, tree, ring, star, mesh, and hybrid topology. There is no particular best topology and a suitable topology can be chosen based on the kind of application of the network .*

>Q2. Which network topology requires a central controller or hub?

    a) Star
    b) Mesh
    c) Ring
    d) Bus

**Answer: a**

*Explanation: In star topology, no computer is connected to another computer directly but all the computers are connected to a central hub. Every message sent from a source computer goes through the hub and the hub then forwards the message only to the intended destination computer.*

>Q3. _______ topology requires a multipoint connection.

    a) Star
    b) Mesh
    c) Ring
    d) Bus

**Answer: d**

*Explanation: In bus topology, there is a single cable to which all the network nodes are connected. So whenever a node tries to send a message or data to other nodes, this data passes through all other nodes in the network through the cable. It is really simple to install but it’s not secure enough to be used in most of the computer network applications.*

>Q4. A topology that involves Tokens.

    a) Star
    b) Ring
    c) Bus
    d) Daisy Chaining

**Answer: b**

*Explanation: Ring topology involves sending and receiving of data with the help of tokens. Ring started out as a simple peer-to-peer LAN topology.*

>Q5. A piece of information which is sent along with the data to the source computer.

    a) data
    b) module
    c) token
    d) element

**Answer: c**

*Explanation: Token is the information that is sent to the source computer along with the data. This token is then passed to the next node.*

>Q22. The bandwidth of optic fiber is high.

    a) True
    b) False

**Answer: a**
